# IDD-Fa18-Final-Project

### Project Idea

- The goal of this project is to build a camera device that uses CNNs to identify what type of plant species is within a frame. (This project was originally intended to identify bird species, which is why it says that on the LCD of the paper prototype. After further consideration I opted for subjects that lack wings.)  

### Team
- Chris Kruger - crk78

### Expected Parts
- Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- External Battery Pack
- Case
- Button
- 16x2 LCD Screen

The RPi will be entirely internal, whereas the LCD Screen, Button, and Camera (imaging piece) will be externally exposed. The Battery Pack will be entirely external and power the device through a microUSB port located on the bottom of the case.

### Interaction Plan
- A user will aim the frontside camera at a mystery plant and press the capture picture button. After identifying which plant species it is, the name will display on a 16x2 LCD screen on the back of the device.
